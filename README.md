# Why Should I Use This?

About a year ago, I cracked a hash that combined 3 food items (something like `mangoblueberry***`) by using some basic knowledge of its structure. My approach was pretty straightforward: I made a targeted wordlist with known fragments (like `mangoblueberry`) and combined it with `rockyou.txt` using Hashcat’s combinator attack. This worked well because I could focus my resources on a specific pattern, making the process more efficient. But here’s the thing I learned: combinator attacks, while useful, can get super inefficient if you don’t have any context or structure to work with. For example, if I didn’t know the structure of the password at all, I’d have to brute-force every possible combination between two huge dictionaries. If both lists have 10 million entries, that’s 100 trillion (10^14) combinations! At 1 billion hashes per second, that would take around 28 hours to crack. The problem is, lists like `rockyou.txt` have a ton of entries that are completely irrelevant to the password, like `password123` or `iloveyou`. When those get combined with other words, you end up with ridiculous combinations like `mangopassword123` or `strawberryiloveyou` that don’t make any sense, wasting time and resources. Sure, these are very good candidates for a potential password, but if we know the target's password is a combination of food items, we should remove redundant words like `password` and `letmein` from possible candidates entirely. Plus, adding even just one more character to the password makes things a lot more memory-hungry, especially when dealing with multi-word combinations. What really works better is having a more focused list, like one with just food items—mango, blueberry, strawberry, etc. With a list of 1,000 food items, you only get 1 million combinations (1,000 × 1,000), which cuts down the search space a ton. And every combination you generate (`mangoblueberry`, `strawberrymango`) is actually a reasonable guess, making the attack a lot more effective. Without some context, though, cracking something like `mangoblueberrystrawberry` with raw combinator attacks becomes more about chance than strategy. Technically it’s possible, but the hardware and energy costs would be insane compared to just using a carefully curated wordlist. That’s why I made this repository. I had a hard time finding niche, curated wordlists that would actually work for these kinds of attacks, so I decided to make my own.
